# On the Compression of Recurrent Neural Networks with and Application to LVCSR Acoustic Modeling for Embedded Speech Recognition

* Motivation: Speech recognition algorithms are too heavy to directly be put "on-device"
* Contribution: Study techniques that can be used to compress RNN acoustic models
* Method: 
* Results: Reduce size of LSTM acoustic model to 1/3 of original size while negligible loss in accuracy
* Future work: Compression techniques can be applied to RNNs in other domains such as machine translation
